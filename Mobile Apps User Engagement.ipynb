    "This project explores data on existing Google Play and App Store mobile apps, including content rating, genre, downloads, and user ratings. As our company focuses on free-to-install apps that generate revenue via ads, our business model relies on user ad views and engagement. Therefore, our focus in analyzing this dataset is to understand what types of apps attract more users, so our developers can design our products for high levels of user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 2 million apps on each of the two stores our company develops for, and collecting data on all of them is not currently practical. We're using two publicly available data sets that comprise representative samples of the data we're looking for:\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a function to open and explore both data sets. This is a reusable set of code that lets us print easy-to-read rows."
